They continued their journey but were eventually plundered by goblins. Moria became a dark and empty place as its numbers dwindled and the life-span of the Númenořians waned. After many years, the Istari or Wizards appeared in Middle-earth, and some spoke of the mighty works of the past called Khazad-du'm. However, the mines of Moria remained a place of fear and emptiness, as the children of Durin had fled long ago.\n"
